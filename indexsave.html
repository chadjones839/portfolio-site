                <h3>Javascript</h3>
                <p>I have spent nearly 10% of my coding life writing javascript. The other 90%? Solving problems
                    and finding new ways to "make it work". I developed this skill purely through hundreds of
                    hours of trial and error and formal education.</p>

                <h3>CSS 3</h3>
                <p>CSS is the part of developing a web application where you first see it come to life! As a
                    creative-minded marketing professional with the end-user in mind, CSS is where I can make or
                    break the entire usability app. </p>

                <h3>HTML 5</h3>
                <p>From an early age I enjoyed deconstructing household items, usually without parental
                    permission. Seeing HTML is like seeing the inside of your Dad's favorite watch, and unlike the
                    watch, I know how to put HTML back together. </p>

                <h3>React Library</h3>
                <p>I wasnt sure how I should start this by saying "Boy, React sure did make things easier!"" or
                    "Boy, React sure did make thing more complicated...". In the end, my grasp of components,
                    hooks & state, and writing conditionals allowed me to build "JobCannon", and app I'm immensely
                    proud of. </p>

                <h3>C#</h3>
                <p>Consider this a placeholder, if not for the simple fact that I wanted 2 rows of 3 in this
                    grid. C# is a skill I have just embarked on learning in the coming months. I'm not 100% sure
                    what
                    to expect learning this language yet, but give it 3 months and I'll have some witty banter to
                    write here.</p>

                <h3>GIMP Editor</h3>
                <p>Straight out of the YouTube Academy, I taught myself how to use this
                    open-source graphics editor over the past 10 years. It began with a gaudy photoshop to make my
                    sister's forehead look slightly bigger in a family photo. My persistence has resulted in all
                    my friends asking me to photoshop things. </p>
